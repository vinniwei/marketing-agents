## 🔄 WORKFLOW STEPS

### STEP 1: COLLECT INPUTS & UNDERSTAND CONTEXT
**Objective**: Gather all necessary information and establish content foundation

**Actions**:
- [ ] Prompt user for all required inputs above
- [ ] Clarify any ambiguous information
- [ ] Confirm understanding of company positioning and goals

**Output**:
- Completed input sheet
- Confirmed understanding of context

**✋ CHECKPOINT**: Review inputs with user before proceeding

---

### STEP 2: KEYWORD & AUDIENCE ANALYSIS (Multi-Layer Problem Discovery)
**Objective**: Understand the deep, underlying problems behind the search intent

**🎯 THINK HARDER - First-Principles Approach:**
Before jumping to conclusions, challenge yourself:
- "What is the user REALLY trying to achieve?" (Not just what they're searching for)
- "Is my first answer the surface problem or the root cause?"
- "If I had to explain this to someone with no context, what's the fundamental need?"
- "What would the perfect solution look like? Work backwards from there."

**Actions**:
- [ ] Analyze search intent type:
  - Informational (learning/understanding)
  - Transactional (ready to buy/act)
  - Navigational (finding specific page)
  - Commercial (researching before purchase)

- [ ] Map audience problem layers (challenge each layer):
  - **Layer 1 (Surface)**: What they're explicitly searching for
    - *Think harder: Is this what they're really looking for, or just how they phrased it?*
  - **Layer 2 (Deeper motivation)**: Why they need this information
    - *Think harder: What's the emotional or practical driver beneath the surface query?*
  - **Layer 3 (Underlying need)**: The real problem they're solving
    - *Think harder: What problem, if solved, would make this search unnecessary?*
  - **Layer 4 (Desired outcome)**: What success looks like
    - *Think harder: What does "problem completely solved" look like? Be specific.*

- [ ] Identify user journey stage:
  - Awareness (just discovering problem)
  - Consideration (evaluating solutions)
  - Decision (ready to choose)

- [ ] Define content success metrics:
  - What does "problem solved" look like for this audience?
  - How will we measure value delivery?

**Output**:
```
KEYWORD: {PRIMARY_KEYWORD}
SEARCH INTENT: [Type]

AUDIENCE PROBLEM ANALYSIS (First-Principles Validated):
- Surface Level: [What they're searching for]
  Challenge: [Did we question if this is just how they phrased it?]

- Deeper Motivation: [Why they need this]
  Challenge: [What emotional/practical driver did we uncover?]

- Underlying Need: [Real problem to solve]
  Challenge: [What's the root cause, not just symptom?]

- Desired Outcome: [What success looks like - be specific]
  Challenge: [What would "perfectly solved" look like?]

USER JOURNEY STAGE: [Stage]
SUCCESS METRICS: [How we measure value]

VALUE DELIVERY STRATEGY:
- Key insight 1: [How we'll deliver value]
- Key insight 2: [Unique angle]
- Key insight 3: [Differentiation]

VALIDATION QUESTIONS (Answer these to ensure depth):
- [ ] Have we gone beyond the obvious answer?
- [ ] Would this problem analysis surprise someone in our industry?
- [ ] Can we clearly articulate WHY each layer leads to the next?
- [ ] Is the desired outcome specific enough to design content around?
```

**✋ CHECKPOINT**: Validate audience analysis with user

---

### STEP 2.5: PROBLEM VALIDATION (Using Top-Ranking Content)
**Objective**: Validate and refine our problem hypothesis by analyzing what Google ranks at the top

**🎯 KEY ASSUMPTION:** Google ranks content that best solves user problems at the top. Therefore, top-ranking pages reveal what problems users actually need solved.

**🎯 CONTEXT TO BRING FORWARD:**
- Primary keyword: {PRIMARY_KEYWORD}
- Initial problem hypothesis from Step 2: [4-layer problem analysis]

**Actions**:
- [ ] Use Ahrefs MCP to find top 3 ranking pages for {PRIMARY_KEYWORD} in {TARGET_COUNTRY}
- [ ] Use Web Search to find top 5 ranking pages for {PRIMARY_KEYWORD} in {TARGET_COUNTRY}
- [ ] For each top-ranking page, quickly assess:
  - What problem is this page trying to solve?
  - What does the title, structure, and content reveal about user needs?
  - Does this confirm or challenge our Step 2 hypothesis?

**🎯 THINK HARDER - Problem Validation:**
- "What problems are ALL top pages addressing?" (Common thread = validated problem)
- "What problems are SOME pages addressing?" (Potential gaps or adjacent needs)
- "What does the way they solve it tell us about what users expect?"
- "Did we miss anything important in our Step 2 analysis?"

**Output**:
```

### STEP 5: CONTENT FORMAT & TYPE STRATEGY
**Objective**: Determine the optimal content format that best solves the validated problem

**🎯 CONTEXT TO BRING FORWARD:**
- Primary keyword: {PRIMARY_KEYWORD}
- Validated problem understanding: [From Step 2.5]
- Competitive insights: [From Steps 3 & 4]
- Goal: Choose format that enables us to solve the problem 2-3 layers deeper than competitors

**🎯 THINK HARDER - Format as Problem-Solving Tool:**
- "What format best serves the VALIDATED PROBLEM?" (Not just what's ranking)
- "How does format choice help us go 2-3 layers deeper?" (Enable better solutions)
- "What format allows us to apply successful principles MORE completely?" (From competitive analysis)
- "What format constraints keep us FOCUSED?" (Depth over breadth, no scope creep)

**Actions**:

**Part A: Analyze Competitor Formats**
- [ ] Review competitor content formats from Steps 3 & 4:
  - What formats are currently ranking? (blog posts, listicles, guides, tools, comparisons, etc.)
  - Are there interactive elements? (calculators, quizzes, configurators, assessments)
  - What's the dominant format pattern?
  - Note any outliers (different format that's still ranking well)

**Part B: Map Format to Problem-Solving**
- [ ] For the validated problem from Step 2.5, consider:
  - What format best serves Layer 1 (Surface problem)?
  - What format best serves Layer 2 (Deeper motivation)?
  - What format best serves Layer 3 (Underlying need)?
  - What format best serves Layer 4 (Desired outcome)?

**Part C: Format Opportunities**
**Think harder:** Don't just copy competitors - think about what format enables BETTER problem-solving.

- [ ] Evaluate format options:
  - **Listicle**: Would numbered format make solution more scannable and actionable?
  - **Interactive tool**: Could a functional tool solve the problem hands-on?
  - **Comparison format**: Does the problem require decision-making between options?
  - **Data-driven study**: Would original data make the solution more authoritative?
  - **Step-by-step guide**: Is the solution sequential and needs clear progression?
  - **Ultimate guide**: Does comprehensive coverage serve the problem best?
  - **Mixed format**: Would combining formats solve the problem more completely?

- [ ] Validate search intent alignment:
  - **Informational** → Educational blog post, how-to guide, explainer, ultimate guide
  - **Transactional** → Product pages, pricing pages, "best X for Y", buying guides
  - **Commercial Investigation** → Comparison articles, reviews, "X vs Y", roundups
  - **Navigational** → Brand/product specific pages, landing pages

- [ ] Consider user journey stage:
  - **Awareness** → Educational, broad coverage, beginner-friendly
  - **Consideration** → Comparison, evaluation criteria, pros/cons
  - **Decision** → Specific recommendations, clear CTAs, decision support tools

**Output**:
```
