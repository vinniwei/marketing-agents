### STEP 5.5: CONTENT FORMAT & TYPE STRATEGY
**Objective**: Determine the optimal content format and type based on competitive analysis and search intent

**Actions**:
- [ ] Analyze competitor content formats across Steps 4 & 5 data:
  - What content formats are currently ranking? (blog posts, listicles, guides, interactive tools, comparisons, videos, etc.)
  - Are there interactive elements? (calculators, quizzes, configurators, assessments)
  - What's the dominant format pattern across top 5?
  - Note any outliers (different format that's still ranking well)

- [ ] Validate search intent against content format:
  - **Informational** ‚Üí Typically: Educational blog post, how-to guide, explainer, ultimate guide, FAQ
  - **Transactional** ‚Üí Typically: Product/service pages, pricing pages, "best X for Y", buying guides
  - **Commercial Investigation** ‚Üí Typically: Comparison articles, reviews, "X vs Y", alternative pages, roundups
  - **Navigational** ‚Üí Typically: Brand/product specific pages, landing pages

- [ ] Identify content format opportunities (what could work BETTER than competitors):
  - **Listicle**: Would numbered list format make it more scannable and shareable?
  - **Interactive tool/calculator**: Could a functional tool provide unique value and engagement?
  - **Comparison format**: Would side-by-side comparison make decision-making easier?
  - **Data-driven study**: Would original research/data make it more authoritative?
  - **Step-by-step guide**: Would sequential how-to format be more actionable?
  - **Ultimate guide**: Would comprehensive, all-in-one resource be more valuable?
  - **Hub-and-spoke**: Would pillar page + supporting content work better?
  - **Mixed format**: Could combination approach (e.g., guide + embedded tool + comparison table) be optimal?
  - **Micro-app**: Would an on-page application (quiz, configurator, generator) provide unique value?

- [ ] Consider content format based on user journey stage:
  - **Awareness stage** ‚Üí Educational, broad coverage, beginner-friendly
  - **Consideration stage** ‚Üí Comparison, evaluation criteria, pros/cons
  - **Decision stage** ‚Üí Specific recommendations, clear CTAs, decision support tools

**Output**:
```
